Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

    Block elements are those that take up the full width available on a web page, 
    effectively blocking out any other elements from sitting next to it on the left or right. 
    Inline elements are those who only take up as much width as is needed to display the contents of the element, 
    thereby allowing other elements to be in line with the inline element.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 

    An absolutely positioned element is an element whose computed position value is absolute or fixed.
    The top, right, bottom, and left properties specify offsets from the edges of the element's containing block. 
    Absolutely positioned elements that have height and width set to auto are sized so as to fit their contents.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 

    By utilizing the padding and margin properties in CSS.

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?

    It entails the content, borders, margins, and padding.
    Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
    Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
    Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
