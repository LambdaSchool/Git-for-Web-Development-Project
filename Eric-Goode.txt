Stretch Questions

1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 

An absolutely positioned element is an element whose computed position value is absolute or fixed.

3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?

By using the CSS box model. Margin property allows the element to take up the amount of space it needs and padding specifies its width.

4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

Button , input , select , and textarea are display block by default. <span> , <strong>, and <img> tags are examples of inline by default elements. Navigational links are inline-block by default.

5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 

A box that wraps around every html element. The box model consist of layers where the outmost is called margin, then border, padding, and the innermost is content. In CSS, you can set width properties for specific content but for the elements to respect the width we specified then we must use a margin, border, and padding around the element.
