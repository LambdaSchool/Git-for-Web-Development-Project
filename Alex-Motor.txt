Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
inline elements are nested in the same line as other elements. (Like spans, text, images, etc). Block elements occupy an entire line block (like divs)

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
The element will be taken out of the flow and will stay at the exact same position. Other elements might take the space originally taken by the element and elements might overlap.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
position relative?

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
Block elements are divs, sections, and header. Inline elements include images and spans. A navigation is an inline block element I think. 

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
The box model is a way of organizing HTML Elements. ALl elements that exists as content in an HTML document are placed into boxes made up with the content in the center, the border around the content, the padding between the content and the border, and the margin nested outside of the border. We can manipulate the sizing of these elements with their selectors in css. We can call the element and set a defined value for each of these elements.
