    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
      Answer: The box model is the standard spacing which a webpage sets itself. This can cause elements on the page to overlap making
      the page not look as clean as it should. This can also be frusting for people to have to use as it causes you to also factor in padding into your sizing. 
       The fix for this is that you can use the Alternative CSS Box Model which sizes directly to the border of your box.
