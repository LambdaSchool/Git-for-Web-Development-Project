Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

	A block element will not allow content to remain inlie and will push them above below and the element. 
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
	- An element positioned absolutely will reference its parent element in positioning, and will be
	positioned relatively to that.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
	- You can add margins or padding to the element, and also adjust the display type.
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
	- Block: div, h1, p
	- Inline: a, span

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
	- The box model describes the space surrounding every element in HTML. Although positioning and size (i.e. ewidth) for these elements can 
	be relative, you can set fixed widths or have them set as a percentage of containers and other parent elements.
