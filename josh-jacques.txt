    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
        From the inside out;
        Content, Padding, Border, Margin

        Border is not the same as Margin
        i.e if you background-color:black and increase the padding, the backgroudn color will grow with the padding. The margin will always be the white space between 2 elements and will not increase the size of the background-color.
