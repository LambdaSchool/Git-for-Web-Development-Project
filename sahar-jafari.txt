Stretch Questions

1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    Block elements behave as a block that take the whole space vertically. Blocked elements don't sit next to any other elements.
    Inline elements take space as wide as they are, and they sit next to other inline elements.
2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    Absolute positioned elements are positioned relative to their closest parent with position relative. If there is not such parent, the element is positioned relative to the body.
3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    display: inline-block;
4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    display block: div, h1-h6, p
    inline: span, a
    inline-block: input
5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
    Browsers render all elements of a document as boxes laying beside or on top of each other. And each element has a width and height and consists of margins and paddings and border. Paddings and border add to the measurement of the element, while margins just add space between elements.
    `box-sizing: border-box` changes the behavior of elements so that a bigger box wraps the element and its paddings and border, yet margins stay out of the wrapper box. This way the outer width and height of an element is not affected when we change paddings, and it will not mess up the layout of our document.
