    1. What is Semantic HTML? 
    Semantic elements in HTML clearly describe what they mean. This is important so that screen readers, browsers, developers, and web crawlers can understand your webpage.
    
    2. What is HTML used for? 
    HTML is used to display data, rather than execute tasks. It is a markup language.
    
    3. What is an attribute and where do we put it? 
    Attributes are placed inside the angle brackets of the starting tag in order to provide additional information about the element. It lets us add information we don't want displayed, like a link to an image when we only want to see the image, not the link itself.

    An id is an attribute we add to elements in HTML which can be referenced as selectors in CSS which reference only one single element.

    8. What elements can I add an id to? 
    You can add an id to elements found in the <body>, but not to the <base>, <head>, <html>, <meta>, <scripts>, <style>, and <title>.

    9. How many times can I use the same id on a page? 
    You can only use the same id once on a page. They are unique and can not be used on multiple elements like class can.

    10. What is a class? 
    A class is an attribute we can add to HTML elements. We can then use the class name to reference the element for use in CSS. Classes can reference multiple elements at once.

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    Inline elements only take up the space they need, width and height can't be set. Block elements create a line break and the width and height can be set.

    Position based on nearest ancestor. Without an ancestor it is based off of body.
    
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    display:inline-block

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    block: <div> <address> <ul>
    inline: <span> <input> <textarea>
    inline-block: <img>? **<button> <select>**

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
