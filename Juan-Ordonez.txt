Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

    An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document layout flow. Instead, it sits on its own layer separate from everything       else
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
      box-sizing:border-box
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
  Block: div, h1, header    Inline:a, textarea, Inline-block:img
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 

The box model refers to the margin,padding, and border of an element. Margin affects the space between that element and other elements. Padding
refers to the space between that element and its own border. And border is the space that surrounds the element.
The fix to that problem is setting border-box:box-sizing on our entire document.
