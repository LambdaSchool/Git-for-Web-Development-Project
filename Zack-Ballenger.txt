Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

    --- Inline elements' dimensions are relative to each other, so if you want to change only one inline element's spacing, it won't work. Block elements aren't absolutely relative so you can change individual elements spacing

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 

    --- You'd think it would be absolutely positioned but it's relative to the last element 

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 

    --- Margin 0 auto? Not sure. 

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

    --- Block = p, h1, h2 --- inline = br, a

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 

    --- It's just like organizing your stuff before you move houses: If you throw everything into the back of a truck unboxed, it's gonna be a bad time once you get ready to do stuff with it all.
    --- To make all elements reflect changes with widths, you gotta pack it up nice and neat first, and to do that it helps to think of boxes that you pack stuff into.
