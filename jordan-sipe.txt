Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        Inline elements do not cause the next set of information to go onto a new line, while the block element does.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        Makes the element sit on a seperate "page" that can be manipulated seperate from the other info on the page.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
        Create the width settings in CSS and set display to flex, and justify-content to space-between. This makes it so all images can be spread out evenly while still staying in their margins.
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        Display: block
        <div>
        <header>
        <footer>
        Display: inline
        <span>
        <img>
        Display: inline-block
        <button>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
        The box model has 4 parts: Margin, Border, Padding, and Content. In order to manipulate these to make the all respect their fiven widths, we can set them to their own width ie:
        margin: 25px (top) 50px (right) 75px (bottom) 100px (right);
        border: 25px (top) 50px (right) 75px (bottom) 100px (right);
        padding: 25px (top) 50px (right) 75px (bottom) 100px (right);
