3. What is an attribute and where do we put it? 
Attributes help define additional characteristics of an element. They can be found at the start of of the specified tag you consist of a name value pair which is enclosed in parenthesis. An example is the class or id attribute in a div <div class='classAttribtues' id='onlyId' > 

4. What is the h1 tag used for? 
How many times should I use it on a page? 
It's the largest there is out of 6 different headings though other headings can be styled with larger fonts. You should typically want it to be the single most largest heading on the page. Any heading h1 - h6 used should only be a on a page one time.

<title>, <link>, <script>, <meta>, <style>, <base>, <!Doctype html> <html>

7. What is an id? 
An id names a element and can only be used one time or you would be better off naming it as a class. 

8. What elements can I add an id to? 
id is a global attribute and can be added to any HTML element though I recommend adding it to a div element that is unique and will only be used once. 

9. How many times can I use the same id on a page? 
You may use the same id only once per page, otherwise it should be a class.  

10. What is a class? 
A class is an attribute just like an id but can be used many times. Its used more for presenting an abstract idea and to generalize than with id which is more specific and there can only ever be one of per page. 

11. What elements can I add a class to? 
A class is used to describe any html elements attribute. 

12. How many times can I use the same class on a page? 
The same class can be used on multiple elements on the same page which require similar attribute styles. 

13. How do I get my link to open in a new tab? 
Use the target =’blank’ attribute in the anchor tag <a href=’site.html’  target='blank'> 

14. What is the alt attribute in the image tag used for? 
If the user experiences problems or the image does not load in their browser then the alt attribute will provide alternative information on the image. This attribute is best for screen reading browser or errors.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
15. How do I reference an id? 
By referencing an id within any html element with id=’idSelectorName’.  

16. What is the difference between a section and a div? 
A section is used to define sections of the html document such as header, footer, aside, or each chapter. It uses html semantics and only follow a single theme. Div is a divisor and can be used for more advanced concepts where the styling does not apply to a general theme though it can still be generally the same as section if the developer chooses. 

17. What is CSS used for? 
CSS is used to style an HTML document as a styling cascade. 

18. How to we select an element? 
Example - every div containing a .blew class on the page. 
    div.blew{
        font-size:2.1rem;
        color:blue;
    }
    or just a single element
    h2{
        color:red;
    }

19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - 
Give me an example of when I might use each one. 
They can both be used as a styling attribute for elements to give them special characteristics. The main difference is that a class is less specific than an id. When you weigh them out a class is worth 10  points and an ID is worth 100 points. This is because classes can be used more than once per page and an ID is only ever used one time per page. It is never okay to use a id more than once because if it is, you need to change it to a class. 
An example is a class of student and an id of Nicholas-Lacapria inside a Lambda html element. <lambda id="Nicholas-Lacapria" class="student"><?php $student-name?></lambda>

20. How do we select classes in CSS? 
By placing a dot before the class name and enclosing the CSS styles with curly braces. Each line should also end with a  semicolon. An example is
	.student{
	width: 40%;
	height: 30%;
	margin: 2px 1px;
	padding:2px 2px 1px 1px;
	border: 20px solid #00CED1;
	
}

21. How do we select a p element with a single class of “human””?
<p class='human'>Text of a human</p>

22. What is a parent child selector? 
When would this be useful? 
It is a selector that uses the > to show what parent is inside of what child. This is useful when you want to only use it in cases when a certain element or selector is found within an occurrence of a different element or selector.
An example is the div parent container  for child paragraph selector
div.parent > p.child{
    background-color:blue;
    color:white;
    font-size:1.5 rem;
}


23. How do you select all links within a div with the class of sidebar? 
div.sidebar > a{
    color:black;
    
}

24. What is a pseudo selector? 
Pseudo class selectors already have pre-defined characteristics or jobs they invoke on an element. There are a lot of these and they handle tasks like hovering or what to do for links that have browser history in it already. 

25. What do we use to the change the spacing between lines? 
line-height: 4px;

rm filename or change chmod write privligaes for the user to delete the file. You must be careful to not select multiple files at once with .filename or *.file selections that may delete more than you need. To recursivly delete add -r rm -r file name or to remove a directory do rmdir directory name

34. Why should I use version control?
Version control is great because it will help debug your project, collaborate with team mates, and it provides extra up-to-date information on the project.

35. How often should I commit to github? 
Commit and push often because there could always be a chance you can lose your work and have to go back to redo it from not adding committing and pushing often enough. 

36. What is the command we would use to push our repo up to github? 
git push origin -u branch-name

37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow. 
First fork or own the repo to your username’s repo, 
Add the TL as a Collaborator, 
Clone the repo to own a local copy on your hard drive, 
create a branch to implement the project with git checkout -b  first-name  so you have a branch to git add . files and commit to
Then push the branch with git push origin branch-name
Once complete make a pull request from the pull tab and press the green pull button then choose your tl's repo on the left and your repo with the branch name on the right and submit the pull request or leave comments on the next page and submit the pull request
Once the TL reviews the assignment it will be merged to the fork onto the master branch in the repo above first-last-name




Stretch Review questions: 
1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
 Inline elements are more flexible than block elements. 
With block elements you are going to get a new line or another element next to each other depending on the height and weight. With inline elements you can place one within another or overlap them to your choosing depending on how you configure the display. Sometimes you will have to choose one or the other depending on the circumstances. However I think an inline-block element is the best to use because 
of how easy the element is to move around or position with float.  

2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
It will have a fixed position based on its computed values. Its harder for an ancestor element to affect it since its value will always correspond to the same position.   

3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
You should use relative positioning and then use top left bottom and right to position it. 
Next margin or padding can be used to altered the width so it still only takes up the space needed but also expands the width.  

4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default?
3 Display Block - div, h1 - h6, form, header or p Any elements that start with a new line are block display elements
2 display inline - span a or img Any items that can be placed next to each other are going to be inline display elements. I've found alot of libraries with nice features seem to make use of this element. For example icons always seem to get displayed with inline elements such as i or span. 1 inline-block - class id or element that is an inline element but also has padding and margins on all four sides.   

5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
The box model is defined by padding, margin, border, and content.
