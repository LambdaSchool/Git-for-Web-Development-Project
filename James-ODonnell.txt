Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

    An inline element does not break the flow of the other material around it, where as a block element will take up its own line and change the look of the HTML. 

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 

    It is positioned within its PARENT element and not positioned directy within the viewport. 

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 

    Play around with the optimal spacing and sizing... or use Flex 

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

    3 Block Elements: <h1></h1>, <div></div> and <p></p>
    3 Inline elements: <a></a> , <img> , <span></span>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 

    There are several different components to the Box model. 
    The content is the inside. The meat. 
    The padding is essentiall the space in between the 'meat' and the border. 
    The border is pretty self explanitory 
    The margin goes around the BORDER and can give extra spacee between other elements.
