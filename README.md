# Git for Web Development Project
In this project you will be using the concepts learned in the Git for Web Development lesson to fork/clone/push/and submit a PR for each project during this sprint.

This project consists of two parts:

## Task 1: Set up Project
You will need to follow the Lambda School Git Workflow to add a file to this project follow the steps below:

- [x] Create your own version of this repo - Fork
- [x] Clone this repo
- [x] Create a branch `git checkout -b 'firstName-lastName'`
  - [ ] Add a file to the project called `yourFirstName-yourLastName`.txt. This should contain the link to your completed codepen from part 2 as well as the review questions/answers
  - [ ] Run your usual git commands for adding/committing and pushing **Be sure to push to your branch!**
- [ ] Create a Pull-Request to submit your work
  - [ ] Use your own student fork as the base (compare across forks, base-fork -> main).


## Task 2: MVP
1. fork this codepen https://codepen.io/BritHemming/pen/eYYEoPa?editors=1100
2. You will be marking up all of the HTML and styling it to look like this: https://codepen.io/BritHemming/full/jONmxOm using CSS
* this should be review from yesterday/ extra practice
3. After you are finished please copy the review questions into your .txt file and answer them
4. don't forget to add, commit and push your changes.


## Task 3: Stretch
Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
-block elements take up the whole line, do not take a width, and automatically push the next element to a new line, whereas inline elements only use up the space that they need, and do not push anything to a new line.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
- it is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor, or the document. it stays in the same place that we put it relative to that other item.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
- set the display to inline-block. this allows you to set a width, and height if needed, but it only takes up the space that the item needs or the amount you assign it.
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
-block:
1. nav
2. address
3. h1-h6
inline:
1. img
2. button
inline-block:
1. span
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
- the box model is where an object is surrounded by its padding, then its border, then margin. making it the smallest of 4 boxes. the fix is a making it so that the sum of all of these parts cannot be greater than the width. this is called box-sizing: border-box.


Stretch Git Tasks
- [ ] While the processes learned here will set you up to be successful in most situations, they are just the tip of the iceberg in learning Git. Independently research the following topics to learn more about Git.
  - [ ] Research and understand what a `merge conflict` is and how to resolve it.
  - [ ] Research the Git commands `pull`, `rebase`, `merge`. These commands will allow you to bring in changes that other developers push to the main branch.
  - [ ] Research the Git commands `reset `, `revert`, `clean`. These commands will allow you to go back and amends previous commits you have made.

- [ ] Research and set up a Graphical User Interface (GUI) Git console. 

- [ ] Research and setup SSH keys with GitHub, so that you do not need to input your username/password each time you push.
