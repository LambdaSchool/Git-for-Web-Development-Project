## Task 3: Stretch
Stretch Review questions: 
    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    A block element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available. 
    An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as needed.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    When an element is positioned absolute it is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
    If there are no positioned ancestors it uses the document body as it's nearest ancestor.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
    From what I just learned below I believe you would want to give that element an inline-block property or just the inline property. 

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    3 display block elements:
    <div>
    <h1> - <h6>
    <p>
    2 display inline elements:
    <span>
    <a>
    1 display- inline-block:
    <span>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
    The CSS box model is the layout and rules of css design.
    It is a box that wraps around HTML elements. It includes margins, borders, padding and content.
    Each of these design elements has it's own box on the page and is enclosed in another. Margin is the outer most box and houses the border box.
    The border box houses the padding box, and the padding box houses the content box.
