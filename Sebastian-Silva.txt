Stretch Questions

make it an inline element and assign it a determined width or use flexbox.

Block by default: Div,section,span

Inline by default:<a> <button>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 

The Box Model is a CSS format that is  essentially a box that wraps every HTML element and consists of margins,borders, padding, and the content.
