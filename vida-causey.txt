                The key difference between block and the inline
                 element is that the block elements take up the 
                 full width available while the inline elements 
                 take the required width to display the contents 
                 of the elements.

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix"
     for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements 
     respect the width we've given them? 

                Every element on a web page (document tree) is a 
                rectangular box, each one of these rectangular boxes 
                has a height and a width.  Every box consists of four 
                areas that layer on top one other. The content area, 
                it being a text, an image or a child element within a 
                parent element.  Padding area that surrounds the 
                content area.  This is followed by border area which
                 is like an outline that surrounds the box.   
                 The Margin area is the transparent white space 
                 outside the box that distances the box from its 
                 neighboring elements.
