    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?

The box model is the content and basically the AOE around it. So you have the content, like an image, well around the image there is some padding.
After that is the boarder, which wraps arounf the padding and content, and wrapping all of it together is the margin. the problem
is that often times when there is a lot of content on a page the images will over lap with one another. 
The "fix" is basically to include padding and boarders in an elements width so that it creates a sort of "barrier" between containers.
