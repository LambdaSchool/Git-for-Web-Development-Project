Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
-block elements take up the whole line, do not take a width, and automatically push the next element to a new line, whereas inline elements only use up the space that they need, and do not push anything to a new line.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
- it is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor, or the document. it stays in the same place that we put it relative to that other item.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
- set the display to inline-block. this allows you to set a width, and height if needed, but it only takes up the space that the item needs or the amount you assign it.
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
-block:
1. nav
2. address
3. h1-h6
inline:
1. img
2. button
inline-block:
1. span
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
- the box model is where an object is surrounded by its padding, then its border, then margin. making it the smallest of 4 boxes. the fix is a making it so that the sum of all of these parts cannot be greater than the width. this is called box-sizing: border-box.
